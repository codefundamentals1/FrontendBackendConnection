# CONNECT BACKEND TO FRONTEND

This project is a simple example of connecting a backend server to a frontend application using Node.js, Express, and React with Vite. It demonstrates the essentials of full-stack development, including how to set up a backend with Express to manage API routes and handle data, and how to connect it to a frontend built with React. The project covers setting up local servers for both backend and frontend, configuring them for smooth data exchange, and using HTTP requests to fetch data from the backend and display it in the React app. This setup is ideal for beginners looking to learn the basics of connecting a Node.js backend to a React frontend.
